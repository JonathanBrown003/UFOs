Using JavaScript to map UFO data in McMinnville, Oregon
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage with dynamic functionality like filtering of collected UFO data. The original page created in the module only had a date filter but this latest analysis of the data added filters for city, state, and country as well. This provides the user more options to analyze the data more thoroughly. 
## Results
Users can now input criteria into the filter fields in order to filter the data. The webpage then will filter to the necessary, inputted criteria's relevant data. The user can filter by date, city, state, country or shape.
## Summary
One improvement to the page would be to add more filters to match the number of headings of data. For instance, duration and keywords within the comment section would be beneficial filters to have for the user to navigate through. 
Another improvement would be dynamically updated data to continuously add new UFO sighting data points. If it were continuously updated, that would be highly beneficial.
